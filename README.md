AI has revolutionized the way image datasets is automatically processed on a large scale. In various fields, including cancer biology, biologists are increasingly relying on AI to analyze vast amounts of cell images. The utilization of advanced microscopy technologies has become crucial in extending the scope of automated cell segmentation to diverse cell culture models.

Recent advancements in high-throughput microscopy and AI-powered image analysis have revolutionized the way scientists investigate biological phenomena. The knowledge gained through such analysis is vast and has a strong statistical foundation. In the field of pharmaceutical research, these capabilities are instrumental in accelerating the process of in vitro drug screening and evaluating efficacy.

By employing automated cell segmentation, scientists can now measure distinct cellular characteristics (such as cell type, division, and shape) and elucidate disease-related traits. Significantly, AI technology can effectively detect subtle alterations over time or in different environments that may otherwise go unnoticed.
